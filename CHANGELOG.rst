Version 2.0.4
--------------
*Status: General availability*


Release Overview:
Versions 2.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2 and 2.0.3 are internal releases which we used to stabilize TestY after the major change
we made (for both front and backend sides), 2.0.4 incorporates the whole set of features from previous 2.x releases with
various bug fixes and this is the most stable production version we have.
The key difference between the 2.x and 1.3.x versions is a redesign of Test Plans & Results and Test Suites & Cases tabs.
For now, there are two ways of how plans/tests and suites/cases can be represented (tree and flat views) and the end user can choose the way he/she likes.

Taking into account this change we eliminated the need of the Child Plans/Suites panes, because for now child items are visually incorporated to the parent one.
We also reworked navigation within the application, so now the user can simply go to any place in the structure of Plans/Suites using sidebar.
Another major change we made is the redesign of filters. The filter is now available on the both Test Plans & Results and Test Suites & Cases tabs.
The filter works in both views (table and tree), it incorporates search bar and allows user to filter the data on a combination of various independent conditions (meaning the filter is not hierarchical).
Also, it is possible to save/edit/remove filters or share filtered representation to the coworker with just copying URL.

Sorting functionality available within a separate menu right next to the filter button.
In addition to the above within this release significant work has been done to preserve the application's state for users and address performance issues.

Also, weâ€™ve added localization and users now have a fully Russian-translated interface.
For backward compatibility we preserved API v1, so if you used it for scripting you can still use it, but all new functions would be available in API v2.

Additional details for Filters
==============================

Test Plans & Results

- **Search bar** by **Name** and **ID**: If the filter is opened without transitioning to a specific plan, it will search tests across all plans.
- **Test Plan**: Plan selector useful for searching by child plans or all plans, when the filter is opened without transitioning to a specific plan.
- **Test Suites**: Suite selector returning the previous behavior; selecting a parent suite will select all its children.
- **Status**: Multi-select **OR** filter, works similarly to filtering in statistics.
- **Assignee**: Multi-select filter.
- **Label**: Filtering by labels, functionality preserved from the previous implementation.
- **Test Plan Start At**: Date range filter, allows selection of specific plans by their start date.
- **Test Plan Created At**: Date range filter, by the actual creation date of the plan.
- **Test Created At**: Date range filter, by the date the test was added to the plan.
- **Show Archived**: Shows archived tests. This will be removed after the rework of archiving.

Test Suites & Cases

- **Search bar** by **Name** and **ID**: If the filter is opened without transitioning to a specific suite, the search will cover the entire project.
- **Test Suites**: Suite selector, similar to the Test Plans filter.
- **Label**: Filtering test cases by labels, works the same way as it did for plans.
- **Test Suite Created At**: Date range filter, by the creation date of the suite.
- **Test Case Created At**: Date range filter, by the creation date of the case.
- **Show Archived**: Shows archived test cases and suites. This will be removed after the rework of archiving.

Important notes

- **Show full tree** toggle: When selecting a plan or suite selector, this toggle displays all suites/plans, regardless of where the filter is opened (e.g., if the filter is opened within a specific suite/plan, the selector will show all suites/plans of the project).
- Filters can be saved, edited, and deleted. You can create an unlimited number of filters.
- Saved filters are available within the project.
- On the **Test Plans** tab, all filter segments except for the label filter **do not affect statistics** in the current implementation
